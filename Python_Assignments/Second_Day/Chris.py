# if, elifs, else statements
# conditionals statements are used to accomade different paths our code can follow.
# if statements when a specific condition is met.

my_bool = True

if my_bool:
    print("my bool is true")

# Nested if statements

# examples

money = 9

if money > 10:
    print("i have some money")
else:
    print("i dont have much money")

# elif - else if
# We dont awlays want to check if every statement equates to true
# mostly only one statement will be true/relevant
# elif makes our code more efficiant
# will only run if no other conditional has been evaluated as true
